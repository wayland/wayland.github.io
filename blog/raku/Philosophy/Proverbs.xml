<p>This is a collection of proverbs and saying that are common in the Raku community.  </p>

<p>As context, Larry Wall was the designer of both languages.  Damian Conway worked closely with him during the design of Raku.  Damian's most prominent role was to interpret and explain what Larry had said.  </p>

<h1>Perl and Raku Diverging</h1>

<h1>Perl quotes updated for Raku</h1>

<p>When Raku was first created, it was created as version 6 of Perl.  Eventually it took on enough life of its own to be given the name Raku.  However, sometime around that point, Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, sadly had to withdraw from the community.  I've thus substituted the name "Raku" in instead of Perl, but the sources will say "Perl".  You can tell when I've done this by the [ ] around Raku.  </p>

<blockquote>
How does [Raku] put the focus onto the creativity of the programmer? Very simple. [Raku] is humble. It doesn't try to tell the programmer how to program. It lets the programmer decide what rules today, and what sucks. It doesn't have any theoretical axes to grind. And where it has theoretical axes, it doesn't grind them. [Raku] doesn't have any agenda at all, other than to be maximally useful to the maximal number of people. To be the duct tape of the Internet, and of everything else. You've heard the joke, I'm sure. How is duct tape like the Force? It has a light side, and a dark side, and it holds the universe together.<ref label="Wall,1999"/>

<blockquote>
Complexity is intrinsically irreducible…but extrinsically redistributable. [Raku] tries to put the complexity where it will do the least harm, and where its victims may have the best chance of surviving it<ref label="Conway,2019"/>.

<h1>Other Quotes</h1>

<h2>Greatness and Freedom</h2>

<blockquote>
True greatness is measured by how much freedom you give to others, not by how much you can coerce others to do what you want<ref label="Wall,1999"/>.

<h2>Dwimmer</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>dwimmer</b>
<div style="margin-left: 1em">DWIM in an acronym for "Do What I Mean", the principle that something should just do what you want it to do without an undue amount of fuss.  A bit of code that does "dwimming" is a "dwimmer".  Dwimming can require a great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesn't stay properly behind the schenes) is called a <i>dweomer</i> instead<ref
