Wayland's Smithy
----------------

Purpose: Blog, so I can write posts about new features for TOP in Raku, and have them added to the Weekly

Next articles:
-	Probably take a break from blogging here to assist with the new website; in particular
	-	raku.org: 
		-	Rework as per https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/ReachingOut/Pathways-of-Entry.xml#id0xffffffffe8ecbc80
		-	Work with librasteve and others to incorporate the docs landing pages; rework the "Introduction" page, and the sub-pages I suggested
	-	Guide
		-	Start an issue asking why we have both the Tutorials and the Guide?  
			-	If we want to keep both, we should do a lot more cross-linking
		-	Rework the first page in accordance with https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/ReachingOut/Pathways-of-Entry.xml#id0xffffffffe8ee7b80
	-	Docs:
		-	Can I integrate my categorisation system into the docs?  
			https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/489
-	Raku: Your Forever Programming Language
	-	Sort of holding this one back until we have the website sorted out
-	Consider updating Technology here
-	Should probably go back to TOP here
-	The Perfects
-	Note somewhere: My Class loading thingy should probably be called "AbstractFactoryHelper" or something; cf. Design Patterns

Blog Technology:
-	Break out components from layout.xsl (see README for completed components
	-	Planned Components
		-	Content
			-	main-content (ie. the part that chooses what content to show)
			-	hover-text
			-	headings? or maybe leave these as part of content.css or something
	-	Final checks
		-	Are there any variables at the top of layout.xsl that are only used in one component?  
		-	Can I make the inclusion of xsl files conditional?  
			-	If I do, there are some call-template statements that will need to be equally conditional
	-	Components (while/after I've merged with TOP)
		-	SVG
		-	Maybe break menu into "sites-menu" and "site-menu"
-	Break layout.xsl into:
	-	interface.xsl
	-	content.xsl
-	Make the Blog main menu just have a list of article series
	-	Menus for each stream, each menu item is an article series:
		-	Raku
			-	Reaching Out with Raku
			-	Raku: Optimised for Fun
			-	DOPE: Data-Oriented Programming Exoskeleton
			-	4M
		-	The Perfects
		-	General Technology
-	Hide a series if there are no visible articles
-	Look at ODT, and try to make my XML move in that direction, so my website will integrate well with ODT output
	-	DocBook is an alternative, but the advantage of ODT is that I could then edit in LibreOffice
-	Go back and look at restructuring other sites to use the new format stuff

Next articles:
-	The Philosophy of Raku
	-	The Philosophy of Raku ... or, how a Servant Leader of the Servant Leader created a Servant Leader
	-	Make Links addendum here, but don't release; will be handy
	-	Do Raku Proverbs Addendum here
	-	The Philosophy of Raku: The Virtuous Life
		-	Search Larry's Postmodernism article for the words "good", "bad", "rules", and "sucks"
	-	The Philosophy of Raku and Data-Oriented Programming
	-	Addenda:
		-	Philosophical Bibliography (Done)
		-	The Philosophies of Languages: What do different programming languages optimise for?  
		-	Raku Proverbs (TMTOWTDI, "less than awesome", "optimised for fun", etc)
-	Article Series: Reaching Out with Raku
	-	Raku: Your Forever Programming Language?  (Ready to Publish)
	-	Pathways of Entry 2: The Hats (Do this after getting the new website and the docs website a little more orderly)
	-	Raku Evangelism (include "How to use the Raku marketing website")
	-	Why Pythonistas should learn Raku:
		-	Grab the paragraph about Python from the "Raku-Forever-Language" article, then add:
			"Naturally there will be some whom it <i>does</i> suit, but the best way to find out whether you're one or not is to learn Raku and experience the alternative.
-	Article Series: "Raku: Optimised for Fun"
	-	Possibly combine the next of these with the Hats idea
	-	Other articles could be
		-	"Raku: With Eldricht horrors" (Call of Cthulhu classes)
			-	The horrors could be compiler internals, or the horrors of other languages :p
			-	Each of us could be planning our own manor estate
		-	"Raku 2050: Cyberpunk Edition" -- Obviously we're all deckers (datamancers)
-	The Perfects

Streams:
-	DOP stream
	-	First of all, write the command called "table", that processes tables on the command line
		-	Do some articles about that
	-       Choose a project to work on as an example of the DOP in Raku stuff; one of 
		-       Event/Community Management (ie. the Jethro replacement) -- this is probably the best go as it's simpler
		-       Human/AI Ticketing system -- this is also a good choice
		-       Finance Engine (ie. backend for things like GnuCash)
	-       Start out just doing stuff with DOP, but will need to rewrite various parts of it for:
		-       Red ORM, once this is integrated with TOP
		-       OTTTER, as this gets created
-	The Perfects (overviews mentioning features):
	-	The Perfect Desk
	-	The Perfect Maximalist Input Setup (keyboards, pointers, etc)
	-	The Perfect HTML Layout Engine (Ploughrowgraph/FlowGrid)
-	4M Stream
-	General Stream
	-	Projects for the Linux Desktop (KDE Activities; project files with multiple documents per file
	-	Unix Piping v2: Upgrading stdin, stdout, and stderr
		-	3 outputs, 3 inputs
		-	One for data, one for logs, one for progress/status
		-	datain (=stdin:0) and logsin (4) and progressin (5)
		-	dataout (=stdout:1) and logsout (=stderr:2) and progressout (3)
		-	Piping commands (|) hooks up all 3 to the previous command
		-	There are standard formats for each channel
			-	Progress: Some newly defined signalling thingy; initial message can indicate what the format of the data is.  
				-	Lines (default)
				-	Tables (cf. -F and -a options to Perl)
					-	Various kinds of table (including CSV, space separated, etc)
					-	Includes logs (see redirection, below)
				-	Trees (ie. XML, JSON, YAML)
				-	Composite (see ASV)
			-	Logs: Probably just copy syslog or journald or something
			-	Data: Supports the formats indicated by Progress.  Minimum should be lines and ASV.  
		-	Still allow redirections, so that eg. logsout can be directed to datain
-	Dive into computerstuff.jdarx and goodmessaging and defendmail, and at least pull out the article content, even if I 
	don't re-release it
	-	Dive into archive.org, and see if they saved any of my content



Publishing process:
-	Copy template
-	Write content
-	Final eyeballs to review
	-	grep to see if there are there any TODO markers left in the file
	-	Ensure that the hidden=1 is removed on both this page, and any related index page
	-	Remove hidden="1" tag
-	Commit manual changes
-	Run autogenerator
-	Eyeball the breadcrumbs, and the next/previous links
-	Commit automated changes
-	Ensure that I haven't accidentally checked in the localhost base
-	Git Push


Published:
-	Raku: Both RPG and Guild
-	Raku: Your First Programming Language?  
-	Raku: Pathways of Entry
-	ASV: A New File Format
-	RaClU: Raku Classification Unification

Waiting for Weekly:
-

Queued for publication:
-	The Philosophy of Raku: The Crux (unpublished)
-	Raku Proverbs -- probably could be published, but would also like more suggestions and feedback

Queued for publication, but waiting on new website/docs:
-	Raku: Your Forever Programming Language?  (Ready to Publish)
